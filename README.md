Hello there I'm Ahmad and this is my first project in a while. I am currently following The Odin Projects' foundation course and this will be the first website that I will be building as a part of an assignment. 

Iam currently learning web development again after giving up due to the terrible resources that I have used beforehand. 

For this exercise I will be building a basic recipe website where I will be using HTML and basic CSS later on. I will also only be using the command line to navigate during this project so that I can learn how to use it better.

The only website I have ever built before was a tribute page to Kurt Cobain one of my favorite and most inspiring artists. Then I had stopped for a while until I found myself motivated through the teachings of my boss and decided to start all over again. 

This might not look good initially, but I might come back later and fix this to showcase my improvements and keep myself motivated.

Anyways,
Thank you for reading stranger, much appreciated.
